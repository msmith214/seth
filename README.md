<h2>About</h2>
Seth is an application for the social media platform Discord. Seth periodically sends messages with colorful hearts in them followed by a button that lets users "pick them up", with the goal being to collect all six colorful hearts. Seth is stateful- it saves user progress to a JSON file once an hour and reads that file on startup to determine where it left off.
